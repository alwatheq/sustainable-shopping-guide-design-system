# Sustainable Shopping Guide Design System

This repository contains the design system documentation and assets for the Sustainable Shopping Guide with Halal and Allergen Detection app, an Arabic RTL mobile application.

## Overview

The Sustainable Shopping Guide app allows consumers to make ethical, informed buying decisions by scanning product barcodes to instantly see:
- Sustainability measures (carbon footprint, recyclability, eco-friendly alternatives)
- Halal verification (certification status, questionable ingredients, halal alternatives)
- Allergen information (allergen presence, cross-contamination risks, safe alternatives)
